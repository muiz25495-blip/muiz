          Common Arguments in FreeFire 
      </h1>
      <p>
          so we're gonna be talking about common arguments in freefire. For example:Andrew vs Hayato, who is better?
    <section> 
        <h2>
            Who is better? ... Andrew or Hayato
        </h2>
        <p>
            Now, Neither Andrew nor Hayato is universally "better"; it depends on your playstyle. Hayato excels at aggressive, close-range combat, as his armor penetration increases when his health is low, making him a high-risk, high-reward character. Andrew is a better defensive choice, as his ability increases armor efficiency, which can be especially powerful in its Awakened form, providing damage reduction for both himself and his teammates.

        <h2>
            Jbieb skill or Andrew Awakened
        </h2>
        <p>
            J. Biebs's skill blocks damage using EP for himself and his team, while Andrew's skill, particularly his awakened version, reduces armor damage significantly and grants additional damage reduction to teammates carrying the skill. Choosing between them depends on playstyle: J. Biebs is for damage mitigation via a shield and EP conversion, while Andrew is for enhanced armor durability and protection against damage.

      <h2>
          Shield points or Damage reduction
      </h2>
      <p>
          Shield points act as a temporary layer of health that takes damage before your HP, while damage reduction lowers the amount of damage you take from each hit. In Free Fire MAX, shield points are often more valuable early on or for surviving burst damage, as they provide a significant buffer without requiring armor. Damage reduction is beneficial for overall durability over time, as it constantly reduces incoming damage on your health and armor.
